- MLP is a type of feed-forward neural network
  - Each of its layers is a fixed size
  - Each layer's output is fed into the next layer as input
  - While feed-forward neural networks are great for tasks involving fixed size input data
  - They aren't as great in dealing with sequences of text data


- Recurrent neural networks
  - Specially designed to work with sequential data of varying lengths
  - The main component of a recurrent neural network (RNN) is its cell
